# Utils React Hooks 

> A hooks library for to help you with your developments with React library

## Commands

Install dependencies

```bash
npm install # or yarn install
```

The recommended workflow is to run TSDX in one terminal:

```bash
npm start # or yarn start
```

This builds to `/dist` and runs the project in watch mode so any edits you save inside `src` causes a rebuild to `/dist`.

To do a one-off build, use `npm run build` or `yarn build`.

To run tests, use `npm test` or `yarn test`.
